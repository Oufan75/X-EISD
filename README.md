# EISD â€“ Experimental Inferential Structure Determination
EISD is Bayeian approach to perform Experimental Inferential Structure Determination of Ensembles for intrinsically disordered proteins.

Program version: 0.1.0  -  Latest update: Nov 25, 2019


## Installation:
You can install eisd from the source:

    git clone https://github.com/THGLab/eisd.git
    cd eisd
    pip install eisd -e .

## Dependencies:
The dependencies for EISD are only numpy and pandas libraries. A proper installation of the package will also install
the requirements.

## Getting Started 
You can either follow along the sample_script.py in the repository or use the commnd line interface to run eisd: 

    eisdshell -d/--datapath, -m/--mode, -s/--structure, -e/--epochs, -o/--output
